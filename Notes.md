**Dockerfile**
- A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- It automates the process of creating Docker images by defining the application's environment, dependencies, and configurations.
- The order of instructions matters because each step creates a layer in the image.
- Using .dockerignore can prevent unnecessary files from being included in the image.
